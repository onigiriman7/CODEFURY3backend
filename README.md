# Helping Labourers find work
With this project we aim to display a prototype to help people working in the unorganized sector find work during the pandemic.
Our model's fuctionalities:
 - Help labourers input their experience and let our NLP model find out their skills and segregate them.
 - Suggest companies to install their plants and industries in villages which has a workforce skewed to their needs.
 - This would help the workers stay safe during the COVID period as they wouldn't need to migrate in search of work.
